## Project Objective

This system allows **automatic and real-time monitoring of student boarding and alighting** using a camera (e.g. ESP32-CAM or USB webcam) and facial recognition. It features a **live web dashboard** for:

- Student check-in tracking
- Time logging
- Attendance summary chart
- Entry/exit history
- Real-time map of school bus

## Technologies Used

| Component             | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Facial Recognition  | Uses `face_recognition` and OpenCV to identify students from saved images. |
| Camera Feed         | Captures video stream (supports IP cameras or local USB webcams).           |
| Flask Web Server    | Serves a local dashboard accessible via LAN.                                |
| Chart.js            | Displays attendance summary in a pie chart.                                 |
| Leaflet.js + OSM    | Shows current location of the school bus (static for demo).                 |
| Attendance History  | Logs all student check-in events with timestamps.                           |

## Setup Instructions

### Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* Linux (tested on Arch Linux), Windows, or macOS
* IP camera or webcam
* Dependencies in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

```bash
# (Optional) Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Or 'venv\Scripts\activate' on Windows

# Install Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> On Arch Linux, use system packages if needed:

```bash
sudo pacman -S python-opencv dlib cmake
```

---

## Run the System

### Start Flask Web Server

```bash
python app.py
```

It will start at:

```
http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

---

## Access from Your Phone (Same Wi-Fi)

1. Get your local IP:

```bash
ip a
```

Find something like `192.168.x.x`

2. On your phone, open browser and go to:

```
http://<your-ip>:5000
```

**Example:**

```
http://192.168.1.10:5000
```

> Make sure your phone is on the same Wi-Fi network.
